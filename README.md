# Drag and Drop

Actually a todo app with some drag and drop feature coded with pure **TypeScript**.

1. run `npm install` to install dev dependencies.
2. Use `npm run build` command to use **WebPack bundling package** for compile all `TypeScript` files to a single `JS` file.
3. run `npm start` to run and see project in browser.
